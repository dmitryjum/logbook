<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
<p>Hey all, my name is Dmitry Jum. I was born and raised in Belarus. I moved to America in 2008, and to New York City in 2009. I've always been interested in action sports, computer technologies, languages and psychology. I have studied at Linguistic University in Minsk, Belarus and I speak English and Russian fluently. I am a self driven, outgoing person, always looking for new challenges to overcome and problems to solve. For the last few years, I have worked as a moving company sales person and estimator, which greatly improved my communication skills. Recently, I completed a 12 week web development immersive course at General Assembly. While there, I acquired skills in programming languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, and built web applications using Rails and Backbone.js frameworks. And I am licensed skydiver as well and usually jump at Skydive the Ranch, so you can find me there.</p>
