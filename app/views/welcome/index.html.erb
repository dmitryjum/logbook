<h1>Welcome to Skydiving Logbook!</h1>
<p>Skydive Pages is a management tool for people involved in the sport of Skydiving. It logs completed jumps, structures their details such as location, aircraft, gear used, exit altitude, freefall time, as well as associated pictures and videos taken during those jumps. It allows users to share jump info/pictures/videos with other users. This is an ongoing project, and features like calendar of events, picture/video comments are currently in progress.</p>
