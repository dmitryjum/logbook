#Logbook

### GA WDI NYC Jan14, Project 1
### Overview

**Logbook** is a interactive skydiving logbook. Which can conatain many users and each user has his own logbok. He can log jumps, edit details of jumps (as jump number, equipment and aircraft that were used etc...). Add pictures and videos for each jump. Logbook was developed as my first WDI project in January 2014. It was developed over a 5 day sprint. It's planned to be in further development to improve overall design and style, add user-to-user interactive features as possibly comments and ability to witness-sign another user's jump.
